# Lab 3 - Harris Corner Detector & Optical Flow


In this assignment, we are going to discuss and experiment with Harris Corner Detector, an algorithm
aiming to identify important features in images such as corners in the objects. Then, we will be
analyzing Optical Flow in images (defined as the apparent flow in pixels from one frame to the
other) using Lucas-Kanade Algorithm. Finally, we will combine the two and use them to study the
movement of objects by focusing on the changes around relevant feature points. As a final result, we
will be able to produce image animations showing the Optical Flow of different parts of the scene as
time passes.

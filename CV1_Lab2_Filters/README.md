# Lab 2 - Neighborhood Processing & Filters


In this second assignment, we are going to experiment with Neighborhood Processing algorithms
and Filters in Image Processing. In particular, we are first discussing the theoretical concepts of
Convolution and Correlation of Filters over Images. Then, we will be implementing some 1D and
2D filters in MATLAB like Gaussian Filters and Gabor Filters. Finally, we are discussing about and
experimenting with practical application of those Filters for different tasks like Image Denoising,
Edge Detection and Foreground-Background Separation.

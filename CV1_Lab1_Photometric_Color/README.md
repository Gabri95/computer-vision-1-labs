# Lab 1 - Photometric Stereo & Color

In this first assignment, we are going to experiment and compare techniques for Photometric and
Color analysis in digital images. In particular, we are going to estimate albedo and surface normals
on different objects, both colored and gray-scaled. Afterwards, we are computing the integrability
check to spot computational errors, and then generating height maps with column-major, row-major
and average methods. The rest of the assignment focuses on color in images. First, we experiment
and analyze different Color Spaces with their advantages and drawbacks. Then, we consider Intrinsic
Image Decomposition with Reflectance and Shading components, trying to reconstruct and recolor
the original image, and proposing different Decomposition components. Finally, we consider the
Color Constancy problem which can be solved employing methods such Gray-World Algorithm,
and we discuss different ways to tackle this task. All output images can be found in the compressed
outputs.zip in each Task subdirectory.
